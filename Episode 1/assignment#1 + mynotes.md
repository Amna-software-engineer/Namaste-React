### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
Website where React Library / other things are hosted.

**Example:**  
It is like YouTube server is in USA.  
Now if you send a request from Pakistan — without CDN, the request goes all the way to the USA (which takes time).  
But CDN is like a nearest server to you (e.g. Dubai) which has a copy of YouTube videos.  
So instead of sending a request to the main USA server, it sends to the Dubai server — much faster!

### Why React is a Library
React is a library because it can be applied to any small portion of an app.  
It can be used just on a header, footer, or any small independent part of the app.  
It is not a full-fledged framework.

### Library vs Framework
Library is used when we want specific functionality.  
Here **you tell when to call the function**, while **it tells where to call your code**.

**Example:**  
- Buying already built house and adjusting according to how you like → **Framework**  
- Buying a plot and building house from scratch according to how you like → **Library**

### Why React is Known as "React"
It is called React because it *reacts* to changes.  
Whenever something changes, it reacts by updating only that specific thing.

### Crossorigin Attribute
The `crossorigin` attribute is the key that unlocks detailed error messages for CDN-loaded scripts.

### What is diference between React and ReactDOM
React is for creating and managing your UI components, while ReactDOM is the "glue" that takes those components and actually renders them into the HTML DOM for web applications.

###  What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
 react.development.js is optimized(larget,slow) for a developer's workflow, while react.production.min.js is optimized(small(no coments,whitespaces),fast) for the end-user's experience
